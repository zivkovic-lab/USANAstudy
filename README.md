# USANA Fiber Study

## Study Design
20 subjucts took either fiber supplements or placebo for 4 weeks, then experienced a 4-week washout period, and swiched the drugs for next 4 weeks. We studied whether fiber supplements increased proportion of SCFA-producing bateria using metagenomic sequencing. We also looked into the changes of SCFAs in stools and the levels of various motabolites in plasma.
